20130928b/Language//A set of strings. Languages can sometimes be described by {regular expression}s, {context-free grammar}s, {context-sensitive grammar}s or a program executed on a {Turing machine}. However {Rice theorem} states that most languages are undecidable.
20130928c/Finite State Machine/Finite State Automaton/A finite state machine is a tuple $\tupl{S,}$
