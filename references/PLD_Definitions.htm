<h1 align="center">Programmable Logic Device Definitions</h1>

<p><strong>Digital Signal </strong>- A digital signal is one whose key characteristic
(e.g., voltage or current) fall into discrete ranges of values.&nbsp; The interpretation
of an <strong>analog signal</strong> would correspond to a signal whose key characteristic
would be a continuous signal.&nbsp; Most digital systems utilize two voltage levels.
&nbsp; Systems with more than two levels include MIL-STD-1553 busses.&nbsp; There are
three ranges defined (with several keep out zones).&nbsp; The newer flash memory devices
utilize four levels for storage, doubling the bit density to two bits per cell.</p>

<p><strong>Programmable Logic</strong> - a logic element whose function is not restricted
to a particular function.&nbsp; It may be <em>programmed</em> at different points of the
life cycle.&nbsp; At the earliest, it is programmed by the semiconductor vendor (standard
cell, gate array), by the designer prior to assembly, or by the user, in circuit.</p>

<p><strong>Gate Array</strong> - Transistors or gates are fabricated in a 2 dimensional
array on a die to form the standard base of an application specific integrated circuit
(ASIC).&nbsp; The devices is programmed by custom metal layers interconnecting nodes in
the array.&nbsp; Some gate arrays have other features such as SRAM blocks, phase lock
loops, delay locked loops, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Standard Cell</strong> - This device differs from the gate array since each
cell may be different and optimized for each "standard" function.&nbsp; There
are no standard layers to the device and each layer of the chip is a unique design.</p>

<p><strong>Field Programmable Logic Array (FPLA)</strong> - And/Or/Invert architecture
with three level fusing.</p>

<p><strong>Field Programmable Logic Sequencer (FPLS)</strong> - Full Mealy state machine.
&nbsp; Programmable AND and OR planes.</p>

<p><strong>Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)</strong> - This device is similar to the
gate array, defined above, with the device shipped to the user with general-purpose
metallization pre-fabricated, often with variable length segments or routing tracks.&nbsp;
The device is programmed by turning on switches which make connections between circuit
nodes and the metal routing tracks.&nbsp; The connection may be made by a transistor
switch (which are controlled by a programmable memory element) or by an antifuse.&nbsp;
The transistor switch may be controlled by an SRAM cell or an EPROM/EEPROM/Flash
cell.&nbsp; Timing is generally not easily predictable.&nbsp; Some architectures employ
dedicated logic and routing resources for optimizing high-speed functions such as carry
chains, wide decodes, etc.</p>

<p>The PROM, PAL, AND PLA are three related devices.&nbsp; They share an architecture that
consists of AND and OR planes.&nbsp; Additional features such as programmable I/O blocks,
storage registers, etc., may be included in these devices.&nbsp; Commercial, military, and
space devices use a variety of programmable elements.&nbsp; A complete list is beyond the
scope of this tutorial. Some aerospace examples are given below.</p>

<p><strong>Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM</strong>) - This device has a fixed, fully
decoded AND plane and a programmable OR plane.&nbsp; The programmable element for these
devices include EPROM, EEPROM, fuses and antifuses.&nbsp; Fuse materials include nichrome
and polysilicon elements.&nbsp; Antifuse structures may consist of Oxide-Nitride-Oxide
(Lockheed-Martin) or amorphous silicon (UTMC) material.&nbsp; Other elements are possible
and may be used in some devices.</p>

<p><strong>Programmaed Array Logic (PAL)</strong> - This device has a programmable AND
plane and a fixed OR plane.&nbsp; Many commercial/military devices use fuses - one device
family uses EEPROM cells and logic (CoolRunner).&nbsp; The UTMC UT22VP10 device uses an
amorphous silicon antifuse as the programmable element. &nbsp; These are often referred to
as <strong>Simple Programmable Logic Devices (SPLDs)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Programmable Logic Array (PLA)</strong> - This device has both programmable AND
and OR planes.&nbsp; The space-flight application that I am aware utilized the bipolar,
fuse-based, 82S100 in the central processing units of the Magellan and Galileo attitude
control computers.&nbsp; PLA structures may also appear as part of some CPLDs.&nbsp; The
two layers of programmable structure add a fixed delay.</p>

<p><strong>Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD)</strong> - A high density programmable
device generally based on the PAL or SPLD architecture.&nbsp; The routing structure leads
to more predictable timing than the FPGA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Programmable Elements</h2>

<p><strong>Fuse</strong> - This is a two-terminal device that is normally a low resistive
element and is programmed or "blown" resulting in an open or high impedance.
&nbsp; Typical materials are nichrome and polysilicon.&nbsp; This is element is inherently
radiation-hard.</p>

<p><strong>Antifuse</strong> - This is a two-terminal device that is normally a high
resistive element and is programmed to a low impedance.&nbsp; Typical programmed
impedances range from 25 to 500 ohms, depending on the specific antifuse material,
technology, and programming.&nbsp; This element is generally inherently
radiation-tolerant; certain versions can be made radiation-hard.&nbsp; The failure mode of
these elements during irradiation is rupture from a heavy ion.&nbsp; For a memory
application, a cell's programmed state may be sensed differentially, with one element
programmed (closed) and the other unprogrammed (open).&nbsp; An example of this structure
is the UTMC PROM family.</p>

<p><strong>Switch</strong> - This device consists of a memory element (either volatile or
non-volatile) which controls a switch.&nbsp; This generally has the highest impedance of
the three classes of programmable elements.&nbsp; The volatile, SRAM-based memory elements
in use today are considered radiation-soft.&nbsp; EPROM, EEPROM, or SONOS
(Northrop-Grumman) non-volatile elements should be relatively radiation-hard to upset.
&nbsp; EEPROM cells have been shown to be susceptible to rupture during write cycles (high
voltage present) by heavy ions.</p>

<p><strong>Volatile</strong> - The memory elements lose their contents when power is
removed from the device.&nbsp; SRAM-based devices are volatile and require another device
to store their configuration program.</p>

<p><strong>Non-volatile</strong> - The memory elements keep their contents when power is
removed from the device.&nbsp; The element may be one time programmable or
"reprogrammable."&nbsp; Examples of the former include fuses and antifuses.
&nbsp; Examples of the latter include EPROM, and EEPROM storage elements. &nbsp;
Programmable devices can be both non-volatile and reprogrammable.</p>

<p><strong>One Time Programmable</strong> - This device can be programmed only once; it's
contents can not be changed.&nbsp; While typically these devices are fuse or antifuse
based, they can also be low-cost EPROM devices.&nbsp; In this case, typically used for
production devices, an inexpensive package is used without a window.</p>

<p><strong>Reprogrammable</strong> - These devices can have their configuration loaded
more than once.&nbsp; SRAM-based devices may be reloaded without restriction.&nbsp; Many
other forms of reprogrammable elements have restrictions on the number of write cycles,
although they are high enough not to be of practical concern for most applications. &nbsp;
The FRAM (ferroelectric RAM) is a non-volatile memory element which a limit to the number
of read cycles; the readout mechanism of this two-terminal element is destructive and
requires a write cycle to restore the contents.</p>
