\subsection{Rabbit Hutch}
A population of guinea pigs were exposed to an overdose of radioactive radiation. At first sight, there seemed nothing wrong with the rabbits, but further research showed their reproduction system was corrupted. It now runs in phases.
\paragraph{}
Suppose that at a given moment their are $n$ rabbits in the hutch. If $n$ is even, the number of rabbits are reduced by half due to a hunger strike. If the number of rabbits is odd, the population grows until it reaches $3\cdot n+1$. This process repeats itself until their is only one rabbit left since their must be two rabbits for reproduction.
